This\ncan be done both by gathering feedback from different types of people\nand by testing and comparing the solutions (see below).\n\nOnce we know what the issues are, we should evaluate if and how we can\naddress them, and also -- if we can't make everyone happy -- what\ngroups of people we want to prioritize (e.g. do we want core devs to\nbe more effective at dealing with the thousands of already existing\nissues, or we want to make it easier for users to report new bugs?).\n\n> > >  But this and other UX issues are difficult to compare on our actual data right now.  I fully expect that just as with the switch to git, we?ll do lots of sample imports and prototyping to ensure that GitHub issues will actually work for us (given our unique requirements), and to help achieve the proper balance.  It does us no good to switch if we just anger all the existing devs.\n> > >\n> > > IMHO, if the switch to GH doesn?t improve our workflow, then it definitely warrants a reevaluation.

I can see several\npossible options:\n* using the on-demand approach proposed by PEP 588, a full migration,\nor some other solution (e.g. parallel, synced trackers);\n* doing a throwaway test migration (import zero/some/all existing\nissues, then discard any new message/issue at the end of the test) or\nusing real issues directly (import zero/some/all issues and keep\nadding real messages/issues);\n  * if we do a test migration and it works, we might need to do a\nsecond, real migration, possibly involving the GH staff twice; if it\ndoesn't work, we discard everything and that's it;\n  * if we use real issues, we might need to migrate things back to\nRoundup if GH doesn't fit our needs and it might be confusing for\nusers;\n* starting from scratch on GH with new issues (at least initially, for\ntesting purposes) or porting some/all issues from bpo;\n  * if we start from scratch we don't need to write the tools to\nmigrate, but we won't have feedback about searching/navigating through\nlot of issues;\n  * if we port some/all the issues, we need to write the tools to do\nit, even if it's just for testing purposes and we end going back to\nRoundup;\n* limiting the test to triagers/core-devs, or involve regular users;\n  * if we involve regular users we might get better feedback, but\nthere's risk of confusion (afaik the only way to inform users on\nGitHub Issues is writing another bot that adds messages) and backlash;\n* doing separate specific tests (e.g. having a read-only repo with all\nthe issues to test search/navigation, and a separate read-write repo\nto test issue creation) or a \"real-world\" test;\n  * some specific tests might be easier to setup (e.g. issue creation\ntest using templates), but for others we still need to import some/all\nthe issues;\n\nIf we agree on testing, I think we need to discuss the options, define\nand document a list of steps, and start working on it.\n\nBest Regards,\nEzio Melotti\n\n> Regards\n>\n> Antoine.\n"

Beta release previews are intended to give the wider community the opportunity to test new features and bug fixes and to prepare their projects to support the new feature release. The next pre-release of Python 3.8 will be 3.8.0b2, currently scheduled for 2019-07-01.\n\n\nCall to action\n\nWe strongly encourage maintainers of third-party Python projects to test with 3.8 during the beta phase and report issues found to the Python bug tracker <https://bugs.python.org/> as soon as possible. While the release is planned to be feature complete entering the beta phase, it is possible that features may be modified or, in rare cases, deleted up until the start of the release candidate phase (2019-09-30). Our goal is have no ABI changes after beta 3 and no code changes after 3.8.0rc1, the release candidate. To achieve that, it will be extremely important to get as much exposure for 3.8 as possible during the beta phase.\n\nPlease keep in mind that this is a preview release and its use is not recommended for production environments.\n\n\nA new challenger has appeared!\n\nWith the release of Python 3.8.0b1, development started on Python 3.9. The ?master? branch in the cpython repository now tracks development of 3.9 while Python 3.8 received its own branch, called simply ?3.8?.\n\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nAs you might expect, creating new branches triggers a lot of changes in configuration for all sorts of tooling that we?re using. Additionally, the inevitable deadline for new features caused a flurry of activity that tested the buildbots to the max. The revert hammer got  used more than once.\n\nI would not be able to make this release available alone. Many thanks to the fearless duo of Pablo Galindo Salgado and Victor Stinner for spending tens of hours during the past week working on getting the buildbots green for release. Seriously, that took a lot of effort. We are all so lucky to have you both.\n\nThanks to Andrew Svetlov for his swift fixes to asyncio and to Yury Selivanov for code reviews, even when jetlagged. Thanks to Julien Palard for untangling the documentation configs. Thank you to Zachary Ware for help with buildbot and CI configuration. Thanks to Mariatta for helping with the bots. Thank you to Steve Dower for delivering the Windows installers.\n\nMost importantly though, huge thanks to Ned Deily who not only helped me understand the scope of this special release but also did some of the grunt work involved.\n\nLast but not least, thanks to you for making this release more meaty than I expected. There?s plenty of super exciting changes in there. Just take a look at ?What?s New <https://docs.python.org/3.8/whatsnew/3.8.html>?!\n\n\nOne more thing\n\nHey, fellow Core Developer, Beta 2 is in four weeks. If your important new feature got reverted last minute, or you decided not to merge due to inadequate time, I have a one time offer for you (restrictions apply). If you:\n\nfind a second core developer champion for your change; and\nin tandem you finish your change complete with tests and documentation before Beta 2\nthen I will let it in. I?m asking for a champion because it?s too late now for changes with hasty design or code review. And as I said, restrictions apply. For instance, at this point changes to existing APIs are unlikely to be accepted. Don?t start new work with 3.8 in mind. 3.9 is going to come sooner than you think!\n\n\n\n- ?\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/attachments/20190605/547d26e8/attachment.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: signature.asc\nType: application/pgp-signature\nSize: 833 bytes\nDesc: Message signed with OpenPGP\nURL: <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/attachments/20190605/547d26e8/attachment.sig>\n"

Remember, every small code change contributes to the grandeur of the Python community. So, whether you fixed a small bug or introduced a large feature, your contribution matters.\n\nIn this alpha version, we've aimed at incorporating all your brilliant ideas and solving the issues that were bothering us in the last versions. It's time for us to come together, test this release, and make it the best version of Python yet.\n\nYou're all doing a fantastic job. Let's continue to support and learn from one another. Here's to making Python even more awesome!\n\nBest,\nEmily"
